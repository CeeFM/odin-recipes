    <p>Water, bro. Life isn't possible without this shit. Like for real I'm being quite serious. Try and imagine life without water, I dare you. You can't, can you? Even the ones who started reading this paragraph extremely confidently and macho and all of that. That's right, water has humbled you again. DEAL WITH IT!!!!</p>
    <p>For real though, water is life. Life without water is death. It's pretty simple. But it's a surprisingly difficult recipe to master.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a cup. If you don't have one you better have solid hands or be ready to chug-a-lug straight from whatever tap or faucet or hose you're working with.</li>
        <li>Fill the cup with water. Preferably filtered water so you're not just drinking fluoride tea. Don't get me wrong, fluoride tea has its benefits I'm sure. But we're making water here, I'm allowed to be a kermudgeon. <i>Also, if you didn't get a cup in the last step, how's it going? What did you end up doing here since you didn't have any cups? I'll be interested to hear about your experience because I really wouldn't know what to do.</i></li>
        <li>Bring the cup to your mouth and pour the water into your mouth. I like to do this without touching the cup to my mouth at all, so it completely waterfalls into my mouth. This often results in me either pouring water all over myself or choking on the massive and rapid influx of water in my face, neither of which are particularly good looks or moves or anything like that. 10/10 I recommend you do that here but it's your call tbh.</li>
    </ol>
