    <p>I mean how much information do you really need. This is an article about cooking a single bowl of pasta for yourself. Like maybe take a second to reflect on how you got here, seriously. Did you have to Google "Cooking Pasta" or some other deeply embarassing search term? You couldn't just figure this one out or read the box or something?</p>
    <p>Well whatever I guess we'll walk you through it anyway since we're here. Plain pasta is kinda hard to make really really good. Sometimes I undercook it. Sometimes I overcook it. I almost never end up with Goldilocks-esque, absolutely just right pasta. But maybe I'm just holding myself to an unrealistic standard again, I have a bad habit of doing that! Anyway, here's how to make some pasta you freak.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a pot, you're fucked if you're trying to follow these instructions without one. Sorry!</li>
        <li>Put a half box or whole box of pasta in that MF</li>
        <li>Put in enough water to cover how many noodles you got in there. Keep in mind, if you put in a buttload of noodles, you're gonna need a buttload of water. And this water is gonna be boiling its ass off, which could get dicey quickly if it's super full. So don't be an idiot, just make a regular rational amount of pasta, don't be a hero.</li>
        <li>Oh shit I fucked all of this up, let's start over. Put the water in the pot first, estimate how much you need to cover how much pasta you want to cook.</li>
        <li>Boil the water, let it really go nuts, let it boil its damn ass off before you put the pasta in.</li>
        <li>Throw all that pasta, or as the boys like to call it - 'sta, in the pot. Lower the heat on your stove down to like medium or something too, no need to blast it anymore. That was fun tho.</li>
        <li>Let it cook for a while. Probably like 10-15-20 mins or something. Keep checking it. Throw it at the wall and see if it sticks. Or just taste it and see if it's too hard or too soft. Either way, again, figure it out dude I'm not your mommy.</li>
    </ol>
